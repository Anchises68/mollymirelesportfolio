    'info': "I produced the Ask Your Doctor medical talk radio show from 2002-2004. During that time, I produced 50 half-hour radio shows. I scouted and hired Dr. Gina Mohr, who co-hosted the show with Dr. Jim Keany. I scheduled the topics of the show, wrote the scripts, authored and was the voice for the commercials, edited the program and promoted it to listeners and to radio stations. Ask Your Doctor aired on the Inland Empire's number one radio station, KFRG 95.1 FM. After a strategic marketing and promotional campaign, Ask Your Doctor moved from a local level to a national level - airing on 24 radio stations across the nation by November 2003.",
